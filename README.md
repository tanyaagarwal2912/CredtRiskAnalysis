# CredtRiskAnalysis
The "Credit Risk Analysis" project aims to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to assess credit risk for potential borrowers. The notebook utilizes TensorFlow to build the model, leveraging a dataset containing various financial attributes of applicants. 
### AIM
This project provides a beginner-friendly environment for aspiring data scientists to dive into the world of credit risk analysis and neural network modelling. The notebook includes detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions, making it accessible and understandable for those new to the field.
This project also gives a good example to deal with missing data.
### Data Set
We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://lnkd.in/dGPufj8G
LendingClub, headquartered in San Francisco, California, was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.
### Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
